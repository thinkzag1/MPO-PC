$d['elder-law']['footp1']='The “graying” of our population, and the increasing number of senior citizens, has led to a growing need for legal representation in planning estates, protecting vulnerable seniors from financial exploitation, seeking appointments as conservators and guardians for the incapacitated, and planning for Medicaid eligibility.  The attorneys at MPO are well versed in these issues and are sensitive to the practical problems of representing seniors.  ';
$d['elder-law']['footp2']='In addition to estate planning specific senior issues, we also handle the representation of incapacitated persons who have been identified as needing either a Guardian to care for their health or living needs or a Conservator to oversee their financial affairs. Our attorneys can file a petition for the appointment of a Guardian and/or Conservator and all related matters for the appointment or removal of a Guardian or Conservator. We can also serve as the Guardian ad litem (the person who represents the rights and interests of the incapacitated person).';
