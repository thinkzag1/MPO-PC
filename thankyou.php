We represent clients on all types of tax deficiencies, collection matters, refund claims, and compliance matters involving income taxes, payroll taxes, trust fund recovery penalties, foreign bank account reporting (FBAR), excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, sales and use taxes, and related penalties and interest.  Our objective is to resolve each client’s unique tax dispute as quickly and efficiently as possible.';

Whether you need advice regarding your first proposed assessment notice, representation at a Collection Due Process (CDP) hearing, submitting an Offer in Compromise (OIC), or are facing an immediate bank account levy, we can assist you during any phase of the collection process.';
